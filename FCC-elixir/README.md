### Actor Model
In simple words, isolated computing system. 

- Processes: 
   - Actor run inside processes
   - Processes are identified by PID
   - Inter-communication by Message Passing
   - Each processes has it's Stack & Heap allocation

- Work
   - Receive message in mailbox
   - Executed FIFO
   - very cheap to create < 3k of memory
   - communicate with message passing
